# Launcher
9.2.7 WoW launcher. 

Based on the old open-source Arctium Launcher, do not ask them for support. 

NOTE: It is not possible to add M2s with this launcher yet, this might be fixed at some point in the future.

## Usage
Use with a correctly set up 9.2.7 client as well as the Sandbox available from [here](https://github.com/ModernWoWTools/Sandbox).
